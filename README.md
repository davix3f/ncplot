# What is ncplot?
 **ncplot** is a TTY program to represent points in the Cartesian plan.
 It's written in C and uses the [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) C/C++ library,
 which is available for a number of Linux distros.
 
 # Why ncplot?
 Because I was bored during a lesson and I had this idea.
 Also, to strengthen my ncurses skills, and I wanted to share-and-show my improvements.
